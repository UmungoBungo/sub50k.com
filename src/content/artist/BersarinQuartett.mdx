It was the winter of 2011, and I was just about to wrap up my studies. Not
having my degree finished, and not being skilled in any particularly useful way,
it was a phase of life where I jumped at the chance to earn anything above the
$20 per hour my cinema job could get net me. This combination of circumstance
led me to a remote country town, about 6 hours west of home, called Kalgoorlie.
Famous in equal parts for a massive mining hole known as the super pit, the
ratio of pubs to the population, and its thriving prostitution scene. My role
was to walk along a straight line, being guided by a hand-held GPS, and dig a
small bit of dirt out of the ground and place it in a labelled packet. At some
point, i would turn around and do this in the opposite direction, a few meters
over. This is soil sampling - a technique of getting a grid layout understanding
(after each packet was analysed) of what could possibly be under the ground. As
I had a heartbeat, I was perfectly suited to be an offsider for the task.

This was the kind of job where you could make great friendships, as it required
little concentration, you could have deep chats over the course of the day and
week. I met a guy around my age, from the opposite side of Australia, named
Chris. We hit it off, I think... though I can't remember many discerning
features about him. You see, our friendship only lasted for the soil sampling
stint. We verbally planned that I would fly over to where he lived, in Canberra,
and go on a snowboarding adventure. Shortly after returning home, I booked a
flight to Sydney, and sent him a message to organise the next leg of travel.
Perhaps a
[cosmic ray bit-flip](https://www.scienceabc.com/innovation/what-are-bit-flips-and-how-are-spacecraft-protected-from-them.html)
meant he never got the message... or perhaps that is why I never got a reply?

Here I was with a plane ticket, and not much else. Getting to the mountains to
snowboard was fairly involved, so i changed my plans and went to the
[Blue Mountains](https://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/blue-mountains). I was
quite fit at the time, as I was gearing up for a marathon, so I thought I would
take advantage of that and go hiking instead. It turned out to be a great little
trip, and one of the only times I have travelled on my own. There was one moment
where I nearly had to recreate
[127 hours](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1542344/) (though I only had a plastic
spork) but overall it was extremely pleasant and wholesome.

So what the hell has this got to do with Bersarin Quartett? Well, during my
hiking, I listened to his first album - the one that has the absolutely
arresting [artwork](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0523843058_16.jpg). The music
created a beautiful atmosphere as I explored waterfalls and rock formations. I
remember taking my earphones out and listening to the birds and different noises
around me, and not being sure of what was a better experience - to have the
soundtrack (a unique experience in its own right) or to be steeped fully in the
natural scene.

I also associate that album with a deep-focus playlist that helped me through
the final stages of my engineering degree. The second album sends me back to
winter, I can almost hear rainfall in the songs. To this day, anything in his
catalogue helps to set the tone when I need to buckle down and get some serious
brain work completed.

Translates to `The moon, the snow and you`. I'm an absolute sucker for the tones
on display here, they just sound so round and organic to my ears.
