It was the winter of 2011, and I was just about to wrap up my studies. Not
having my degree finished, and not being skilled in any particularly useful way,
it was a phase of life where I jumped at the chance to earn anything above the
$20 per hour my cinema job could net me. This combination of circumstance led me
to a remote country town, about 6 hours east of home, called Kalgoorlie. Famous
in equal parts for a massive mining hole known as the super pit, the ratio of
pubs to people, and its historically thriving prostitution scene. My role was to
walk along a straight line, being guided by a hand-held GPS, and dig a small bit
of dirt out of the ground and place it in a labelled packet. At some point, i
would turn around and do this in the opposite direction, a few meters over. This
is soil sampling - a technique of getting a grid layout understanding (after
each packet was analysed) of what could possibly be under the ground. As I had a
heartbeat, I was perfectly suited to be an offsider for the task.

This was the kind of job where you could make great friendships. As it required
little concentration, you could have deep chats over the course of the day and
week. I met a guy around my age, from the opposite side of Australia, named
Chris. We hit it off, I think... though I can't remember many discerning
features about him. You see, our friendship only lasted for the soil sampling
stint. We verbally planned that I would fly over to where he lived, in Canberra,
and go on a snowboarding adventure. Shortly after returning home, I booked a
flight to Sydney, and sent him a message to organise the next leg of travel.
Perhaps a
[cosmic ray bit-flip](https://www.scienceabc.com/innovation/what-are-bit-flips-and-how-are-spacecraft-protected-from-them.html)
meant he never got the message... or perhaps that is why I never got a reply?

Here I was with a plane ticket, and not much else. Getting to the mountains to
snowboard was fairly involved, so i changed my plans and went to the
[Blue Mountains](https://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/blue-mountains). I was
quite fit at the time, as I was gearing up for a marathon, so I thought I would
take advantage of that and go hiking instead. It turned out to be a great little
trip, and one of the only times I have travelled on my own. There was one moment
where I nearly had to recreate
[127 hours](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1542344/) (though I only had a plastic
spork) but overall it was extremely pleasant and wholesome.

So what the hell has this got to do with Bersarin Quartett? Well, during my
hiking, I listened to his first album - the one that has the absolutely
arresting [artwork](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0523843058_16.jpg). The music
created a beautiful atmosphere as I explored waterfalls and rock formations. I
remember taking my earphones out and listening to the birds and different noises
around me, and not being sure of what was a better experience - to have the
soundtrack (a unique experience in its own right) or to be steeped fully in the
natural scene.

Listening to Bersarin Quartett's self-titled sends me back to those few days in
the outdoors. The second album sends me back to winter, I can almost hear
rainfall in the songs. To this day, anything in the catalogue helps to set the
tone when I need focus, whether reading or coding. I hope you find a similar
escape while exploring this music.

Bersarin Quartett has a knack for creating soundscapes that paint vivid images
in my mind's eye. There are subtle sounds to be heard in the background here - a
creaking of a stool during the opening drone loop, some dog's barking with a
reverberation that suggests the outdoors, and insects at dusk. The arrangement
has a subtle sense of foreboding - not outright terror, but that something is
about to be discovered that is ultimately heart breaking. The opening scene of
an English murder mystery perhaps - what is the old priest about to discover?
This is just my mind's eye, mind you, perhaps you imagine nothing at all. FWIW -
the title translates from German to `Things are never as they seem` in English.

Incredible mood, massive ambient built, and overall a fascinating experience.
Pairs well with your own choice of mind-altering substance.

I'm an absolute sucker for the tones on display here, they appear so round and
organic to my ears. I love the interweaving drones throughout this piece, and
the ambient samples contributing a sense of rhythm. FWIW - the title translates
from German to `The moon, the snow and you` in English.
