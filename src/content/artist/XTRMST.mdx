A side project of Davey Havok (vocals) and Jade Puget (guitar) of [AFI](https://open.spotify.com/artist/19I4tYiChJoxEO5EuviXpz?si=zIiu2Gn8Tca7JN1QJGtpig) fame.
The first tracks from this project came out on 4 song casette tape that was given out for free at a record store. The tape had no attribution to who was in the
band, though rumours of Davey and Jade's involvement were confirmed on Twitter shortly after the tape's release. Personally, I love the no-frills production and
self-assured [Straight Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_edge) lyrics. It's not a message I identify with personally, but I respect the passion of
the message and I particularly like that the lyrics are completely unapologetic. Recorded in Jade Puget's home studio, the recordings are very raw, and the main
vocal on every track is a single take. This project was a real flash in the pan, with only 2 live shows being played (with members of
[Saosin](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1NUOfvAhA9AvsF1ISMkgHX?si=nileZQgnQWCs_Wijza5S7g),
[Stick To Your Guns](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2sqrupqcoipb7UzVKApEnJ?si=iDq7GXskRvKYOcrPMhKsQA), and
[Loma Prieta](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4ULLVhwYkyOqpVxe0Asbtt?si=jHHq_slqQVm-ozTE47Jjww) stepping in) and all members of the band going back to their main projects.

The first track on the album that I kept coming back for. The sample here occurs
in the opening 30 seconds, with a great riff and drum groove being given plenty of
breathing room. I'm an absolute sucker for a locked-in drum beat like this, it gives
me flavours of Deftones. Canâ€™t help but nod your head along.

This track (and sample) is all about the lyrics for me.

My favourite track on the album, great straigt-edge lyrics and interesting guitar
work. Hectic guitar work underpinning the vitriol. I don't recall Jade playing the
kind of guitar-work on AFI's albums, so it is great to see him flexing his chops
here.{" "}
