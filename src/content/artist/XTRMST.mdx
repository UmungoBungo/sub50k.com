A side project of Davey Havok (vocals) and Jade Puget (guitar) of [AFI](https://open.spotify.com/artist/19I4tYiChJoxEO5EuviXpz?si=zIiu2Gn8Tca7JN1QJGtpig) fame. I believe they first distributed this on casette tapes at gigs, with no other way to get it. Cool! But also, luckily this eventually ended up on Spotify as well. I love the no-frills production and cringe lyrics spouting off assured Straight Edge ethos ðŸ˜€Â it is kind of goofy, but goofy is an important part of a balanced life.

Starting off with some manic off the wall style, I love the stripped back guitar
riff and simple drum pattern at the 20 second mark. Canâ€™t help but nod your head
along. Iâ€™m always a fan of an artistâ€™s ability to not just pile on a heap of technicality,
but having the confidence to hold everything back and just sit in a tight little
groove.
