In the warmth of a light summer dusk, my father-in-law and I bonded over our
shared love for barbecue while he waxed lyrical about star-gazing. As he pointed
out the brightest celestial bodies in the sky, our conversation eventually
turned to music, and I couldn't help but notice our differing tastes,
particularly in prog-rock. While his generation leaned towards the classic 70s
sound, my appreciation spanned the genre's ever-evolving landscape. This
contrast sparked an idea; it was time to introduce him to the math-rock stylings
of Bats, an Irish band that had captured my attention.

With the barbecue sizzling and anticipation building, I eagerly played some of
Bats' tracks, featuring their signature trio of guitars and scientifically
inspired lyrics. My hope was that their unique fusion of music and astronomy
might bridge the generational gap between us.

But alas, the experiment didn't go as planned. Just a few tracks in, as I
excitedly highlighted the lyrics, my father-in-law flatly declared, "No, I don't
like it. Just turn it off." ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

And so, with a mix of disappointment and determination, I resumed my solo
journey through the vast cosmos of music, eager to explore the boundaries of
sound and share my discoveries with anyone willing to listen. Perhaps I will
fare differently with you, dear reader.

## Track Highlights

There is one complaint some could have about the music of Bats, and that is the
often formulaic nature of their songs. But that doesn't mean it isn't effective,
and this track exemplifies the formula:

- Looping guitar riff, sequentially built upon by the rest of the band
- Scientific and historically important lyrics
- Manic yelling
- Driving rhythms

This was my first taste of their brand of math-rock, kicking off their first
full length release, and it was instant love.

Lyric work here is elegant yet absolutely brutal!

> Oh the arrogance  
> We would do well to accept that the universe wasn't  
> Built for our benefit

I wasn't going to include this track initially, as the screams are pretty
extreme and I don't want to dissuade anyone from giving the band a go... But
once again, the lyrics are center stage. Thomas Midgley Jr. has infamously gone
down in history as not only the creator of leaded gasoline, but also
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Bats have mixed his legacy with a good dose of heavy
metal (pun intended) like a hobbyist chemist just curious as to what could
happen (again, pun intended). Here is an excerpt from the Wikipedia article on
Midgley:

> Environmental historian J. R. McNeill opined that Midgley "had more adverse
> impact on the atmosphere than any other single organism in Earth's history",
> and Bill Bryson remarked that Midgley possessed "an instinct for the
> regrettable that was almost uncanny". Fred Pearce, writing for New Scientist,
> described Midgley as a "one-man environmental disaster."
