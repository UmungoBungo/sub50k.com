Igorrr is a project spear-headed by French musician Gautier Serr, working with
an array of super talented musicians at different points in the discography.
This whole project reeks of obsession and creative output, and while it may be
daunting on first listen, there is so much to be appreciated once some time has
been spent getting familiar with the chopped samples, operatic vocals, and black
metal guitar work. There are a lot genres being melded together, which makes it
hard to describe what music fans this would appeal to... but starting out with a
mindset that you are about to listen to something very heavy would at least be a
strong footing. For me, it actually started out as background music while
coding. Perhaps not intuitive, but I guess the wall of noise created a backdrop
for other thoughts to sit.

My personal favourite track from Igorrr. It first became a go-to as it reminded me
so strongly of [music](https://youtu.be/fUoDgYkhG84) from some scenes in the TV show
Dexter. The singing is absolutely next level, and my appreciation for the album blossomed
from here. The electronic flourishes that come in towards the end of this sample
are a small sign of what can be found throughout Igorrr's discography.

A great display of dynamics, this piece is absolutely massive and should be played
at full volume. The odd time signature and key of the guitar-work reminds me of Opeth's
signature finger picking sections, and the abrasive electronics underneath create
an epic mood. This track again features operatic vocals, of which I'm a big fan.

I would be remiss to not touch on just how wacky this can get. Transitioning from
a black metal wall of noise, Igorrr break out into a chiptune outro, introduced by...
a chicken cluck. They have leant into this theme, with a couple of [merch](https://igorrr.bigcartel.com/product/igorrr-skull)
items up for [grabs](https://igorrr.bigcartel.com/product/igorrr-chicken-vitruve-male)
that give a [wink](https://igorrr.bigcartel.com/product/igorrr-hoodie-grey) to those
in the know. I find these touches to be a welcome reprieve in their work and love
the creativity on display.
