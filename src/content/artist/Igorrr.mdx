My favourite track from them. It first became a go-to as it reminded me so strongly
of the music from the opening credits of Dexter, but the singing is absolutely next
level. Seriously, the passage from around 1:40 to 2:10!

I’m no expert, but around the 4:15 mark, have they got samples slowed down so
far as to hear the individual sample cuts, and timed up to the beat? This whole
project reeks of obsession and creative output, and yeh maybe there is no
thought for what the average person wants to listen to, but I don’t think that
is the point.
