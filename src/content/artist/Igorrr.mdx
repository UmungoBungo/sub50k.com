My favourite track from them. It first became a go-to as it reminded me so strongly
of the music from the opening credits of Dexter, but the singing is absolutely next
level. Seriously, the passage from around 1:40 to 2:10!

I’m no expert, but around the 4:15 mark, have they got samples slowed down so
far as to hear the individual sample cuts, and timed up to the beat? This whole
project reeks of obsession and creative output, and yeh maybe there is no
thought for what the average person wants to listen to, but I don’t think that
is the point.

A great display of dynamics, this piece is absolutely massive and should be played
at full volume. The guitar-work reminds me of Opeth's signature finger picking sections,
with the odd time signature and key, and the abrasive electronics underneath create
a great mood. This track again features operatic vocals, of which I'm a big fan.

I would be remiss to not touch on just how wacky this can get. Transitioning from
a black metal wall of noise, Igorr breakout into a chiptune outro, introduced by...
a chicken cluck. They have leant into this theme, with a couple of [merch](https://igorrr.bigcartel.com/product/igorrr-skull)
items up for [grabs](https://igorrr.bigcartel.com/product/igorrr-chicken-vitruve-male)
that give a [wink](https://igorrr.bigcartel.com/product/igorrr-hoodie-grey) to those
in the know. I find these touches to be a welcome reprieve in their work and love
the creativity on display. There are a few YouTube videos that show the process they
go through for inventing instruments and sounds, and its enjoyable to know the songs
quite well and then discover what that weird noise actually is.
