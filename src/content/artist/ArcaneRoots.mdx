Arcane Roots can reach Muse levels of grandiose, especially through the ample
use of strings on their final album Melancholia Hymns. This album also shows
regular flashes of Kid A era Radiohead through the synth tones.

Calling it quits in 2018 after 12 years, Arcane Roots have been a mainstay in my
prog metal rotation.
