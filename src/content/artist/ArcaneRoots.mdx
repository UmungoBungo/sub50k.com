Arcane Roots have been a mainstay in my prog metal rotation for many years, and
it was a sad day when they announced, in 2018, that they would be calling it
quits after 12 years. It is great to have an opportunity to write about them and
share some samples, but I was surprised to see they fit into the sub 50k
threshold. What is it that elevates comparable bands to selling out arenas,
especially when Arcane Roots have supported such acts as
[Muse](https://open.spotify.com/artist/12Chz98pHFMPJEknJQMWvI?si=3sKwuCfoSASf3Top_tPRwg)
and
[Enter Shikari](https://open.spotify.com/artist/31jvzuB4ikftPQZJwrYfCF?si=DgYcRIcPT4CvjYYXTlFxzw)?

They don't shy away from technical riffs and time signatures, and can reach Muse
levels of grandiose, especially through the ample use of strings and synth on
their final album Melancholia Hymns. This album shows regular flashes of
[Kid A](https://open.spotify.com/album/6GjwtEZcfenmOf6l18N7T7?si=C09nUCbfTeCYghaAFfolzw)
era Radiohead through the tones and is well worth a full listen-through.

Their most played track on Spotify, and rightly so - this one is an absolute belter.
I remember sharing this with a friend, with whom I had a shared love for Biffy Clyro.
I described it as the outro to [That Golden Rule](https://open.spotify.com/track/0wZG9XVpW62EoJsTAs5YKN?si=ac6779f597134ff5),
but dialled up to 11. It features strong dynamics and I particular love how the heavy
motif expands over the course of the song. A truly rewarding listen, multiple play
throughs of this will wear a groove into your brain that only enhances the enjoyment.

IMO, progressive music is about overcoming the initial confusion of a technical arrangement,
and then embracing the familiarity on subsequent listens. I'll grasp one rhythm or
riff, and then that expands outwards in the song and album. I became intimately familiar
with the confusing rhythms in this song when I learnt to play along on guitar (not
that well, there are some really quick chord shape changes!) and it holds a special
place in my brain.

I really wanted to highlight multiple songs from [Melancholia Hymns](https://open.spotify.com/album/0H78GRqI872n6wv2BMgAHR?si=H0LUDRR6Rq-xcy_Kl8KY6w)
as it is such a varied listen. Ultimately I chose Half the World as it shows a different
side to Arcane Roots from the above tracks. These are some S-tier vocal melodies,
underpinned by powerful yet restrained instrumentation. It is perhaps their most
well-written and accomplished track, and exemplifies what they are (ðŸ«¡ were) capable
of.
